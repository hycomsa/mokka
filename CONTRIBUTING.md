# Contributors guide

## Submitting bugs
Before submitting a bug, please do the following:
* **Make sure you’re on the latest version.** If you’re not on the most recent version, your problem may have been solved already! Upgrading is always the best first step.
* **Search the project’s bug/issue tracker** to make sure it’s not a known issue.

**If you don’t find a pre-existing issue** you are free to create new one just please make sure you have added as much details as possible:
* **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
* **Paste error output** or logs with proper formatting (i.e. wrapping in three backticks ```)
* **Include system details** like what the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.

## Contributing
If you’re able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the code!
