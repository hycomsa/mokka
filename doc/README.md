# Conventions for ADR

As of result of ADR-0001 we have introduced ADRs to persist architecture-related decisions.

## Tools
To create and manage ADR-s we use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Content convention

Only obligatory sections are:
- Name (in first line)
- Context
- Status
- Decision

If there is need for additional you can add them freely :)

# Conventions for C4

## Tools

[C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML) is used for creating C4 related diagrams.
